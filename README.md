# Touche

A lightning-fast, distraction-free board to capture, refine, and organize your notes.

The idea behind this project is to keep the act of taking notes as simple as possible — a clean, organized way to capture and complete tasks without distractions. No paywalls, no ``unnecessary`` logins, and no cluttered interfaces getting in the way of what truly matters: jotting down your thoughts quickly and clearly.

It follows a simple philosophy: just keep it simple.


The storage of the notes is only saved in the browser’s local storage for now.
